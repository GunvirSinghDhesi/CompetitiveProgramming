Competitive Programming Solutions
Overview
This repository contains my personal solutions to various competitive programming problems, primarily from DMOJ (Don Mills Online Judge) and the University of Waterloo's programming contests. The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, share my approach to solving complex algorithmic challenges, and contribute to the competitive programming community.

Repository Structure
DMOJ: Solutions to problems from the Don Mills Online Judge.
Waterloo: Solutions to problems from University of Waterloo contests.
Each folder contains subfolders organized by contest or problem set, and each solution is named according to the problem code or title.

Technologies Used
Language: Solutions are primarily written in Python, C++
Environment: Developed and tested in various IDEs and programming environments.
Problems and Solutions
A brief overview of each problem, along with my solutions, can be found within each subdirectory. Each solution file includes comments explaining the approach and thought process.

How to Use
You can browse through the folders to view solutions. To test a solution, you can copy the code and run it in an appropriate IDE or compiler that supports the used programming language.

Contributing
While these solutions are based on my personal approach to the problems, I welcome suggestions and improvements. Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and open a pull request with your contributions.
